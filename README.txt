Introduction:
The premise of this project is that American politicians must speak to their electorate with the level of linguistic sophistication that the electorate understands. As a result, political speeches are great indicators of the state of the American vocabulary. This project then sets out to prove that over the last century, the vernacular used by the average American — representative of the electorate — has been drastically simplified. This will be achieved by doing unique word counts on American political speeches.


Motivation:
As the 2016 presidential primaries unfold in perhaps the most polarized political climate since the Civil War, there is one thing that unites both parties — shock at the success of Donald Trump’s candidacy and his ability to galvanize a group of Americans despite weekly gaffes and a generally “unpresidential” demeanor.
To date, the results of the primaries have defied prediction after prediction from even the most reputable pollsters and election forecasters. Though this project will not examine Trump specifically, we think it is a step towards understanding the relationship between the political climate and the current American electorate, and perhaps also a way to understand how an apparently bigoted, alarmingly unpredictable, and unqualified candidate has amassed such strong support.
